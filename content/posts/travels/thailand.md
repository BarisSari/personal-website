description: "The sabbatical trip between July 15-September 9, 2025. First stop: Bangkok, Koh Phangan & Koh Samui"
---

After six years of work and never taking a break longer than a month since university, I finally took a four-month sabbatical, spending two of those months on the road across four countries: Thailand, Vietnam, Japan, and South Korea. Thailand was my first stop. Getting there was almost a disaster: I flew from Berlin to Bangkok via Zurich, rushing through airports after a delayed flight, convincing a passport officer to let me skip the queue, and catching my Bangkok connection with barely five minutes to spare. The adventure began before I even landed. This first post dives into what I learned, what surprised me, and the real-life tips I wish someone had told me before I touched down in Thailand.

### TL;DR

*   **Cash is king**: ATM fee is usually **220‚Äì250 THB**. 7‚ÄëEleven is quite common but requires a **minimum 200 THB** for a card payment. Some hotels/caf√©s add a **3‚Äì5%** card fee.
*   **Getting around**: In Bangkok, **Grab/Bolt** work well; on islands, a **scooter** is the most flexible (only if licensed and experienced). For **taxis/tuk‚Äëtuks**, agree on a price or insist on the meter.
*   **Island transfer**: From **Surat Thani Airport,** you can buy **bus/van and ferry with optional hotel drop** packages right outside arrivals, often **cash only**. You can also book on **Seatran** website and check in at the pier.
*   **Weather**: Rainy season = mixed sun and short showers; fewer crowds, but sunsets are not always postcard-perfect.
*   **Vibe**: People are friendly, but English can be limited. The internet is full of **scam** stories; with basic precautions, you‚Äôll be fine. The local mentality sometimes feels like **‚Äúscam where you can.‚Äù**

### Arrival & Connectivity

*   **Arrival card**: You need to fill [this form](https://tdac.immigration.go.th/arrival-card/#/home) out. I did it **online before the flight** and showed the **QR code** to the officer. Otherwise, you need to be sure that you have internet when you land, fill the form while waiting and it can be frustrating.
*   **eSIM**: I bought mine on **KKday** before my flight and had a **5G** connection the moment we landed. There are plenty of eSIM counters at the airport, too.

### Money & Payments

*   **ATM fees**: Expect **220‚Äì250 THB** per withdrawal. The **ATM Fee Saver** app helped me find more reasonable machines. Highly recommend it.
*   **Cash usage**: Street food is **cash‚Äëonly**. On islands, many restaurants either accept **cash only** or have a **minimum spend** for cards.
*   **Card quirks**:
    - 7‚ÄëEleven requires a **minimum 200 THB** for card payments.
    - Some hotels/caf√©s/restaurants add **3‚Äì5%** for card.

### Bangkok: Transport & My First Shock

*   **Grab/Bolt/inDrive**: Prices are fair; **Grab‚Äôs scheduled ride** worked for me. I used **inDrive** to sanity‚Äëcheck what a trip should cost.
*   **Mini‚Äëstory ‚Äî my first Grab**: On the way to the hotel, my driver was **watching Instagram reels and texting** while driving. Every time he lifted his head, he‚Äôd slam the gas. We almost hit bikes and cars **a few times**. **Horns everywhere**. I arrived in one piece, but it definitely **set the tone** for the rest of my rides. It made me think: ‚ÄúOkay, so this is how rides will be on this trip.‚Äù
*   **Taxi/Tuk‚Äëtuk rule**: Only get in if the **price is agreed** or the **taximeter** **is on**.
*   **River boats**: The tourist boat stops by many sights and dodges traffic but it‚Äôs **cash‚Äëonly** of course. Different colored lines exist. On a more local boat (I guess it was the orange route), I learned it literally **runs on whistles**: when boarding finishes, the crew whistles and the captain moves. Primitive? Yes. Old school? Yes. Effective? Yes, I guess.

### Islands: Getting There & Getting Around

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*XOeNHFOTl6xCAK0yLPPwNw.jpeg)

*   **Local transport**: **Songthaew** (shared pick‚Äëup trucks) are common. Regular taxis rarely use the meter and quote **fixed, high prices**.
*   **Grab**: Works on **Koh Samui** but is **pricey**. **Koh Phangan** has limited app options.
*   **Roads**: Especially on **Koh Phangan**, roads are hilly and patched. If you **lack a motorcycle license/experience**, I don‚Äôt recommend renting a scooter. I witnessed **two motorbike accidents** on my way to Fisherman‚Äôs Village market in a taxi.
*   **Surat Thani ‚Üí Islands**: Right after arrivals, the **second building** sells **bus/van and ferry with optional hotel drop** combos; most take **cash** of course. Booking on **Seatran** with a card is possible; just **arrive early at the pier** for check‚Äëin.
*   **Direct flights to Samui**: Only one airline (Bangkok Airways) operates all routes, so prices felt **inflated**.

### Beaches & Areas

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*82R1q4NSZ2fKNR0dPz6IdA.jpeg)

*   **Lamai Beach**: Clean water; lots of restaurants, bars, massage places, and a night market. **3/5 days** the sea was **calm as a pool**.
*   **Fisherman‚Äôs Village**: The classic **lively** area if you want more buzz.
*   **Haad Yao**: It was disappointing to see that there are lots of waves and also you can‚Äôt do anything in the morning because of the tide. In the mornings (July, rainy season), the tide pulled the water back so much that swimming wasn‚Äôt really possible. In the afternoon, there‚Äôs enough depth but too wavy. Again, this might be related to the rainy season, I don‚Äôt know.

### Tours

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*9Ga1kXPRbzVLuJz9TnE-7Q.jpeg)

*   **GetYourGuide** had the widest menu of tours I saw.
*   Other apps to check: **Klook, KKday, Viator**.
*   An **Elephant Sanctuary** visit is worth doing once but check ethics and reviews.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*0WoJMp4D0l6YMU3oSAUKZg.jpeg)

### Food & Drinks

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*V4mT6pLv9_RpxJxNIRNOKg.jpeg)

*   Delicious overall, but expect a **sweet** profile: many sauces use sugar, sweet syrup or **coconut milk**. After a while, I genuinely **missed salt, garlic, and black pepper**.
*   I ate Pad Thai and other dishes in some‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs say‚Ä¶ _highly questionable_ spots. My stomach survived; yours might not. If you‚Äôre not used to it, skip those stalls. **Food poisoning is very much on the menu.**
*   **Coffee**: Even for an **Americano**, they ask **‚Äúsugar or no sugar?‚Äù,** a fun culture shock üòÑ why the hell does everything have to have sugar!
*   **Fresh shakes + water**: Lifesavers in the heat. Avoid dehydration. Hotels offering **cold water** are a big plus.

### Weather

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*POL0OallxxwcIR3Bjf9--Q.jpeg)

*   **Rainy season** meant half‚Äësun/half‚Äëcloud with **short downpours**. Fewer tourists made the beaches nicer. **Sunsets** were okayish only for 1‚Äì2 days. Most days are not picture‚Äëperfect because of clouds.
*   **Pricing note**: Rainy season usually brings **lower hotel rates**, but in mid‚Äë2025 I noticed a bit of a **‚ÄúWhite Lotus effect‚Äù.** Buzz around the show seems to have made the prices up a lot (especially **Samui/Phangan**). Deals still exist; **book a little earlier** or look **one street back** from the beach.

### Safety & Beach Culture

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*t1G4B7gcfiDBWjLRUmFECQ.jpeg)

*   **Solo experience**: I took **AirPods, a bit of cash, phone** to the beach; no issues. Didn‚Äôt hear theft stories around me either. Might be low-season related, though.
*   **Sunbeds/Clubs**: Instead of a fixed **daybed fee** (like in Turkey), I often just **ordered a drink** and stayed. Many beaches are accessed through a beach bar/resort. I felt odd the first day, but it‚Äôs simply **how access works** there.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Md7UBPgmpJkjlrnNOQk-wQ.jpeg)

### Flying

*   I used **AirAsia** three times and checked my suitcase each time. **Bag drop** took less than **15 minutes**. I checked in via the app; **morning flights** were **on time**. Felt like Asia‚Äôs Ryanair, but **better**.

### Social & Language

*   I checked **Couchsurfing Hangouts, TripBff, Fairytrail** but found very little, probably because of the **low season**.
*   People were **smiley** (refreshing after Germany üòÑ), but the **language barrier** was real; small talk rarely flowed.
*   **Tourist mix**: I heard so much German that on some days it felt like **more German than in Berlin**.

### A Small Story ‚Äî The ATM Ate My Card

On my very first day, an ATM **swallowed** my card! For a moment, I thought my trip was over before it began. Luckily, the adjacent currency‚Äëexchange staff **called customer service** for me, found an **English speaker**, and even **called my hotel**. The hotel panicked (cute), but the next day I got an email from the bank, and I went to the **bank and got my card back!** The level of helpfulness was great. But since then, I double-checked every ATM before using it. Highly recommend you do the same!

### Scams & How I Avoided Them

Thailand is super touristy and the web is saturated with **scam threads**. My simple rules:

1.  **Taxi/Tuk‚Äëtuk**: Price **written** or **meter on**, or I walk.
2.  **Cash‚Äëonly** places: always ask for a **receipt/bill**.
3.  **Motorbike**: take photos and check the scratches, don‚Äôt give your passport.
4.  **Tours/Transfers**: book through **reputable platforms** (e.g., GYG). Don‚Äôt buy from a random street tout in a hurry.
5.  When someone says the palace or the museum is closed, don‚Äôt believe them.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*_W8Fz6xRO_7ASA3pRAjF7A.jpeg)

6.  When someone wants to sell you something, say thanks and keep on moving.
7.  I had an aggressive old lady situation when I was trying to buy a ticket for the ferry. There were a few counters, so I wanted to check the offers before I bought it. In one of the counters, after I said, ‚ÄúThanks, I‚Äôll consider it‚Äù, she started yelling: ‚ÄúEvery company has the same price!!!!‚Äù. And guess what, she was the only one with this behavior and more expensive tickets. The best thing to do is just ignore them and move on.
8.  **ATMs**: Prefer **inside‚Äëbranch machines**; double‚Äëcheck on‚Äëscreen fees. Always decline the ATM‚Äôs conversion and let your bank do the FX.

_Nice gesture:_ at my stay in Bangkok, I had an **early check‚Äëout** and would miss breakfast, so they **packed a sandwich** for me. Small things like this are why I‚Äôd go back.

### Final Take

**Would I go again? Absolutely.** In the dry season, I‚Äôd add **Phi Phi, Krabi, Chiang Mai**, and spend **more time** in **Bangkok** _(it‚Äôs huge, I love the vibe, and there‚Äôs still a long list)_ and **Koh Samui**. Even in the rainy season, it was great: set realistic expectations + bring cash + stay cautious = a solid trip.

If you have read until the end, thanks a lot! Here is a ‚ù§Ô∏è for you.
