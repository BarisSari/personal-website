If you think Vietnam is all cheap beer and scenic hikes or rides, think again. This country hands you curveballs, chaos, and tourist traps on a daily basis. Welcome to round two: **‚ÄúThe Bad.‚Äù**

### Accommodation & Booking

**Booking a hotel in Vietnam often felt like gambling**. And I was in a phase that I was losing both at gambling and love at that time...

Vietnam‚Äôs **hotel ratings** are **fiction**. You might book a place with promising photos and reviews and 3‚Äì4 stars, only to be dropped at a _‚Äúsister hotel‚Äù_ a block or far away. **Review farming isn‚Äôt a joke** here. Negative reviews vanish. The same thing is valid for restaurants or bars.

Do you remember **the hotel** that **tried to scam** me as soon as I arrived in Hanoi? It **has rating of 9.3 on booking**, and hundreds of reviews... Do you want to hear something even worse? Let's continue with another story!

#### Story Time: My Mental Breakdown after 1 week in Vietnam...

Three hours on a so-called _VIP bus_, tossed around like luggage, and Hanoi greets me one more time, with a downpour of rain this time. All I want is a place close to the airport before my early flight the next morning. I **book a hotel** on booking.com as usual, something with a _high rating and hundreds of high reviews_. The confirmation‚Äôs _fishy_, though: it‚Äôs a partner hotel, there is less info than usual, and the payment was taken instantly.

I get in a taxi and spend almost **an hour driving** through random backstreets in the rain, **hunting for this hotel** that apparently **only existed online**. We get to **the address** and, surprise, there‚Äôs nothing there! _**No sign, no building, nada.**_ The taxi driver starts giving me that ‚Äúyour problem, not mine‚Äù vibe, and he‚Äôs annoyed that he can‚Äôt drop me off at that address. I‚Äôm flipping between Google Maps and the Booking app. I find more suspicious stuff. The **hotel name in the URL** is **different** from the name it‚Äôs written in the confirmation page. The photos of the hotel have a label with a different name. There are **0 reviews on Google Maps**. **My battery is 3%.** I feel like everything is going wrong, and I have no idea what to do!

I ask the taxi driver to go to the main road and stop at the first hotel we see. We end up at some old hotel that looks like still in the 80s. Of course, the guy at the reception is happy to see me, and then charges me double the price, but I have no other options.

I check in, take a shower, and try to relax a little bit. Turns out there were **two places with almost the same name on Google Maps.** _Of course there were._ I found the second one way too late. Did I mess up? Did the hotel ever exist at the second address? _Who knows._ **booking.com failed me, and Vietnam completely broke me, at least for a night.**

### Food & Drink

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*B88-RjdxKzj76Xi7gTx-tQ.jpeg)

**Vietnam is a coffee country, no doubt!** They proudly offer _**salt, egg, coconut, and yogurt coffee**_ everywhere. As far as I see, they use Vietnamese, _robusta beans, and dark-roasted._ They have _preparation like cocktail-shakes_ which is **untypical** in Western world. However, if you drink your coffee black and love the taste of coffee like me, you will try these Vietnamese coffees once, and then you will hunt down the new wave caf√©s or Western-style caf√©s, or overpriced caf√©s...

By the way, if you like Vietnamese coffees, they have workshops as well, which could be a good activity during the day.

Google Maps‚Äô menus are usually up to date. But one thing that drove me nuts in Vietnam was the insane amount of review farming. **So many places just delete negative feedback and pump up their ratings with fake glowing reviews.** I saw _‚Äúthe best coffee I ever had‚Äù_ or _‚Äúlife-changing pho‚Äù_ for hundreds of restaurants; either travelers have no standards whatsoever, or every spot is somehow _Michelin-level_. Trust me, I lost count of how many times I walked in with high hopes and left totally disappointed. At some point, I just gave up and stuck to the Michelin Guide places whenever possible. Even fucking McDonald‚Äôs manages to get a 4.5! **If you‚Äôre relying on Google Maps ratings here, good luck, because they honestly mean nothing.**

_**Street foods are hit or miss.**_ Walk into a street food place, and you‚Äôll see _**meat and chicken** hanging out, **unrefrigerated, all day.**_ You ask yourself, do they really get fresh meat every morning at dawn, or do those meats hang there for days? Remember, it‚Äôs over 30 degrees day and night! _Take a gamble, bring stomach meds if your stomach is not strong!_

Ho Chi Minh City has many 24/7 convenience stores that make things easier than any other city in Vietnam. For example, I wanted to hit my protein target every day, and there was literally nothing with high protein in markets except the ones in HCMC.

**Hygiene? Questionable at best.** I found a 4.9-rated restaurant in Hoi An Ancient Town. It was a home restaurant, which means it‚Äôs actually the home of the family that runs the restaurant. So you use their toilet and eat on their terrace. I finished my meal, asked to use the restroom. They pointed me their bathroom, _the floors were sticky enough, and guess what: no sink!_ Only a shower and a toilet, and that‚Äôs it! And in many other places, **if the bathroom has soap, consider it a luxury.**

One day in Hanoi, on my personal Michelin Guide quest, I found a place near my hotel: right in Old Town, famous for its chicken ph·ªü. There was trash all over the floor, just piling up. On both sides of the place, there were motorbike repair shops. So the whole time I was eating, it smelled like straight motor oil and exhaust smoke. The ph·ªü was okay, but I still have no idea why that place is on any list.

### More Hygiene & Safety Issues

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*_bAVxTgxs3lk6iBZmrwdAA.jpeg)

**Homemade alcohol? Sometimes, lethal**, tragic stories in Hoi An on Reddit: [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/s/yvr9SrEz41), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/s/z9e4PVCXYL), [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/s/5v5C88GiPt). The worst thing is the restaurant is still open, and they still serve homemade alcohol...

[Food poisoning?](https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/s/OznVgnBsir). Will probably happen.

In central Vietnam, in one of the most touristy beaches in Da Nang, you might swim in sewage water! **[No, I‚Äôm not kidding](https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/1meq56r/dirty_water_in_my_khe_beach_da_nang/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)**.

_I‚Äôm coming from the Mediterranean Sea! Come on‚Ä¶_ This was one of the most disappointing things to learn. I spent 10 days next to the ocean without swimming. Luckily, my hotels had swimming pools.

**Water shoes are a must, especially on water sports tours.** The ones given in cave tours were so slippery, many people struggled to stay upright (in Phong Nha‚Äôs caves).

In Hanoi, as usual, I had my AirPods on, walking fast, exploring streets. **Some touts showed naked woman photos in the street to convince me to get a massage, which was unexpected, and honestly DISGUSTING!** And many many times, they cut my walking path with their motorbikes, showed me some drugs, and then they left when I said "no".

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*gwmiFG5fBkRYLnhe3P5sPw.jpeg)

I mentioned a few **scams** in different sections so far, but one of the tourist guides summarized them **in a nutshell**: be aware of **fake touts/tourist guides, shoe cleaners, and fake drivers.**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*dDv7n9SVMGDnBuljvT0VcQ.jpeg)

It‚Äôs wild how the **same problems keep popping up** year after year, but Vietnam seems totally content to just let things roll. **Nothing ever really changes** as far as I heard or read, probably because the tourist numbers keep going up and the country‚Äôs getting more popular no matter what. I guess when people keep coming, there‚Äôs no real push to fix the chaos or step up the infrastructure. If you‚Äôre hoping for things to suddenly get better, good luck. I wouldn‚Äôt bet on it.

### Tours & Activities

**Some tours were great, some were memorable for the wrong reasons.**

I booked an _English-guided_ Clam Islands trip, through Viator, almost double the normal price, just for the language. Turns out, the guide barely spoke _fifteen words of English_ all day. The rest? **All local Vietnamese tourists.** And yes, they‚Äôre **super loud**, a lot of talking, shouting, music, video calls...
Still, even with the language barrier, they tried to include me. They used Google Translate and asked these questions: **‚ÄúHow many children do you have?‚Äù** and **‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you travel with your wife?‚Äù**. Not kidding, literally the first questions they asked. Apparently being a 30-year-old single guy in Vietnam is everyone‚Äôs business.

Even at the hotel the staff went: _‚ÄúHope you liked it here, next time bring your girlfriend!‚Äù_ So from young high school kids to grandpas, everyone wondered the same thing. It was definitely a bit weird.

#### Mini story: The Water Pavilion Photo Fail

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*jpGylzSr23ESQRPjO4bkYA.jpeg)

One tour day, we reach the famous Water Pavilion in Trang An. I‚Äôve taken great pictures for a young couple on this trip (at least that‚Äôs what they said after I sent photos to them), so I handed over my camera to them. It‚Äôs my turn now! I‚Äôm finally going to get one of the rare photos that includes me. They take dozens of photos, but every single one, my head or my umbrella totally covers the Pavilion. _Thank you, mysterious couple..._

**Another tour, adventure this time:** It took me a good thirty seconds just standing there, trying to work up the nerve to jump into pitch-black water inside Phong Nha cave. The guide said it was forty meters deep, and let‚Äôs be real, no way I‚Äôm the only one thinking about what might be swimming down there with me. _But hey, I was one of the 3 people in the group who jumped on that water, not bad, ha?_

### Random Thoughts

1.  **Hanoi‚Äôs Old Town** is a **paradise** for **fake brands** and confusing price tags. Shopping here flips between haggling for 20 minutes or just accepting nonsense pricing (‚Äúscam where you can‚Äù is standard). 100,000 VND can mean anything. Don‚Äôt overthink it, _said the guy who overthought the entire trip..._ It's never really about the money, it's cheap. However, it's about the constant feeling that you're getting played.

2. **Don‚Äôt text while walking.** One step, and the sidewalk flips. Another step, there‚Äôs a motorbike parked.
3. **ChatGPT was blocked** in August 2025, and the only way around that wall is a VPN (I used NordVPN all the time).

**Vietnam tested my patience, sense of humor, non-verbal communication, and my digestive system.** But even a place that wears you out eventually gives in and hands you a few wins with epic tours, nature and food. Stay tuned for the final round.
