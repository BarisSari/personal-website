**Three weeks in Vietnam** after two months around Asia, and I‚Äôm still convinced this is the most chaotic country I‚Äôve ever set foot in. I **crossed** the whole place from **North to South: over 2000 kilometers**, two domestic flights, two sleeper buses, more motorbike taxis than I want to remember, and five tours for good measure. **Six cities later**, I promise: this isn‚Äôt a dreamy ‚Äúsweet and sour‚Äù blog post. The country confuses, impresses, exhausts, surprises, and sometimes terrifies you, often in the same morning. This **wasn‚Äôt** a **honeymoon trip**. **It was mostly survival mode**, and here‚Äôs what actually happened.

By the way, this post kicks off a three-part series. I call it **‚ÄúThe Good, the Bad, and the Ugly‚Äù**, but don‚Äôt expect the classic movie order. We‚Äôre starting with The Ugly, moving on to The Bad, and finally, saving The Good for last.

### TL;DR

*   **E-visa:** Got in 3 days, **$50** fee, [here‚Äôs the official website](https://evisa.gov.vn/).
*   **ATM/Money:** Use **VP Bank** (no commission). Currency exchange at jewelry stores in big cities, zero fee, and the best exchange rate ever. The **ATM Fee Saver** works in this country as well.
*   **Payments:** Most places charge 3‚Äì5% extra on cards.
*   **Transport:** Sleeper buses = danger, ‚ÄúLimousine/VIP/Boss/Premium‚Äù bus rides = not that premium and also danger, crazy motorbike mess everywhere. Not environment friendly, but use flights as much as possible!
*   **Food:** One of the best cuisines ever! Lots of cheap Michelin guide options in different cities.

*   **Coffee:** Unusual coffee options: salt, egg, coconut. But Western-style coffee is also available at new wave caf√©s.
*   **Hygiene:** It doesn‚Äôt exist much...
*   **Safety:** It doesn‚Äôt exist much...
*   **Reality:** Scams, price chaos, review farming, and more oddities.
*   **Would I go again?** Probably not. Maybe in 20‚Äì30 years, if tourism and infrastructure get a major upgrade.

### Arrival

Getting in was technically easy: the **E-visa** took three business days, cost **$50**, and the official site worked as promised. Landing in Vietnam, however, was far from gentle. At Hanoi airport, I barely made it out before 10 or 15 fake Grab drivers started all shouting, all insisting they‚Äôd take me anywhere. Finding my actual, legitimate car that I booked from booking.com took ages and a lot of ‚Äúno, thanks‚Äù. For peace of mind on airport transfers in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh, booking.com worked, but always double-check prices.

When it came time to actually get to my hotel, things got worse. The **arrivals area** was **chaos**, but the **traffic jam** was even **more chaotic**! By the way, **Grab works** in most airports, but half the time, finding the actual pickup point might take some time.

International flights in Saigon? You‚Äôd better show up at least three hours early; otherwise, you can miss your flights because of the notorious airport queues. [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/1hzqixs/what_absolute_nonsense_is_saigon_airport/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) wasn‚Äôt kidding. Hopefully, this will get better once they open a new airport. Meanwhile, **domestic flights** are way **less hassle**: if you book something early or late, you‚Äôll get through it all much faster.

**Vietnamese Airlines**? I used it for domestic flights, and it was a **good experience** in general. Online check-in works, and early flights were on time. No complaints.

**Vietjet**? Could you imagine that **online check-in** is **not possible** for a flight in 2025? If you use Vietjet, it‚Äôs possible‚Ä¶ Say hello to long queues and frustration!

If we get back to my first hours, it definitely set the tone: every step forward meant facing a fresh challenge. I wondered many times if I‚Äôd made a huge mistake coming here alone...

### Money & Payments

You reached your hotel, what's next? It's time to get some cash. You need it for almost everything.

There are two winners for money exchanges in Vietnam:

1.  The **winning** **bank** is by far the **VP Bank**. Zero commission! It depends on which ATM you use as to how much you can withdraw, but the **ATM Fee Saver** app can help you see the maximum withdrawal limit of ATMs without visiting them.
2.  If you come with USD or Euro cash, great! Because exchange at **jewelry shops** has the **best rates ever**, and they don‚Äôt charge any commissions. It‚Äôs old-school and honest. Show your banknotes, and they will use a calculator to show you how much they are willing to give you in VND.

**Card payments**? It was very easy in Ho Chi Minh City. But in other places, it **was not possible sometimes**. Also, hotels, restaurants, and even tiny shops almost always **add** an **extra 3‚Äì5%** charge. Don‚Äôt ask why: accept it or walk away.

Airport transfers booked with hotels can be three times the Grab rate. Yes, **my first hotel** in Vietnam **tried to scam** **me** as well‚Ä¶ They wanted to add a **10% surcharge** for card payment and charge a **3x rate** for an airport transfer. I learned my lesson and never used these hotel services, especially in main cities.

And don‚Äôt get me started on magnets: the same one in Old Town cost 30k at one shop, 100k at another. All logic goes out the window. Even buying damn water in the same market two days in a row was at different prices! Absurd!

### Getting Around

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*qVKXjYJOXLf5y4gmPM14dg.jpeg)

Let‚Äôs talk about **moving in Vietnam**: they don‚Äôt have **public transportation**, **not** in any **practical** sense. There is a metro in Ho Chi Minh City, and that‚Äôs it, I guess. The rest seemed completely impractical. And **millions of people** use **motorbikes**, or should I say **everyone uses motorbikes?**

If you‚Äôre not getting on a motorbike or squeezed in a car, you‚Äôre not going anywhere. Tourists like me are trapped using **Grab or Indrive** (thank god those work).

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*Wygn2X_5N3crlJhZc97PXg.jpeg)

On the street? **Walking** is a **disaster**. I quickly learned that sidewalks are just motorbike parking lots, always full, every meter. Even **walking straight** for five minutes is a **luxury**. **Crossing the street** is a daily **stress** test. **Traffic** is pure, **unpredictable chaos**. The only technique? Close your eyes, pray, and keep your pace. You might make it, you might not.

Want to use the **sleeper bus** for long trips? Good luck. I‚Äôve never **feared for my life** on a bus as much as in Vietnam. The **roads** are **bad**, the **buses** never stop **honking**, and every bump launches you a few centimeters in the air. Sleeping? Forget it. But hey, sometimes you don‚Äôt have another option. You go on ‚Äúhighways‚Äù but **roads** are so **bad** that the maximum speed is 60‚Äì80 km/h, and guess what, it‚Äôs still **nerve-racking**! Unbelievable traffic on highways as well! You might think that I exaggerate it. I‚Äôm adding a few links if you want to check it further: [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/1mznr3x/serious_warning_about_traveling_by_sleeper_bus_in/), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/1m9ia3z/has_this_become_normal_in_vietnam/), [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/1evuwsy/sleeper_bus_from_hell/).

The so-called ‚Äú**limousine**‚Äù between Ninh Binh and Hanoi was just as bad: two to three hours of **top-level anxiety**, the bus zigzagging across every lane, **3-lane highways packed with five cars** side by side, the constant noise of horns, and the seatbelt barely holding you in place. Sometimes it didn‚Äôt! There are tons of operators, all with ‚Äú**VIP**‚Äù or ‚Äú**Boss**‚Äù or ‚Äú**Premium**‚Äù branding ([this is one of them](https://12go.asia/en/operator/hoang-minh-limousine); [here‚Äôs another](https://dailylimousine.com/)), but **honestly**, it‚Äôs **the same shitshow** everywhere.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*FRCoMXwe1Sf2JzrYDu7EOA.jpeg)

The fake taxi/motor driver scam is relentless. Even inside the airport, they hassle you; in the city, they approach you all day, every day. Several times, I heard stories, of ‚Äú**Grab-like‚Äù cars** **driving** you **somewhere random** and then **demanding triple** the fare **for** the **return**. Sometimes, if you decline, drivers get openly disrespectful or aggressive.

#### Mini story
I arrived in Ho Chi Minh City, checked into the hotel, went for lunch nearby, and was walking back to my hotel, my AirPods on, doing my best to ignore the whole chaotic universe outside. **Some guy** chilling on his motorbike **tried** the classic: **‚ÄúHi, how are you?‚Äù** **I said ‚Äúthanks‚Äù** **and** just **kept walking**. Big mistake, apparently. The **dude** immediately **yelled** after me: **‚ÄúFuck you!‚Äù** And that‚Äôs it, his entire script: **‚ÄúHi, how are you, fuck you.‚Äù** Welcome to tourist zone hell, where getting cursed out is just part of **avoiding a scam**. There‚Äôs **no way** to escape from them, and they are aggressive when they can‚Äôt scam you. No guidebook prepares you for getting cussed out on a street in Saigon, but honestly, **it‚Äôs not the worst thing here**.

_Disclaimer:_ Vietnamese traffic is next level. The number of motorbikes is honestly mind-blowing, way more than anywhere I‚Äôve ever been. To be fair, if you compare it to Thailand, pretty much everyone here actually wears a helmet and goes slow enough for normal humans to process what‚Äôs happening. But even with helmets and less insane speeds, it was pure chaos for me. I couldn‚Äôt process the feeling that every street crossing or sideways walking was a struggle.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*OsQtoljOwedj_6GCTY3pcg.jpeg)

In summary, **the entire transit experience, every arrival, every street crossing, every booking, and ride was a total mess.** You‚Äôre always anxious, always negotiating your way through motorbikes, scams, or taxi hustlers. Of course, it changes insanely of your trip and experience. No filters, that‚Äôs exactly how it was! By the end of each day, I was mentally drained. Vietnam demanded all my patience and pushed my limits.

If you think it‚Äôs all the mess and done, wait for part II! **[It gets weird in new ways.](https://barissari.com/blog/travels/vietnam-ii)**
