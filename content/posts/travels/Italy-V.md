### Italy V: Firenze Rocks, Uffizi Gallery and more…

It was my 3rd time in Florence and I was there for 4 days this time between June 18–22. No matter how many times you spend in Florence, you never get enough of it! It's just an amazing city. But there was one thing different for me this time, which is I compared it with mostly German cities especially Berlin, not with other European cities or Turkey. I mean I always had Berlin in mind when I liked or disliked something about Florence. Anyways, before diving into this new post, I'm sharing the link of the previous post which also has lots of information about Florence.

Let’s start from the transportation. How can you go to Florence from Berlin? For me, I tried two options:

-   Direct flight from Berlin to Bologna (RyanAir), using Markoni Express to go to the Bologna Central train station in 7 mins, using fast train to go to Florence in 40 mins.
-   Connection flights from Florence to Zurich, and Zurich to Berlin (SwissAir). Florence Airport is super small and there are only a small amount of flight per day. That’s why the only option for Berlin was the connection flight.

Unfortunately, the latter cost me to spend one extra day in Zurich because my Berlin flight was cancelled. At least, Swissair booked an hotel, gave me vouchers for shuttle and meals, and booked another ticket for the next morning.

My main purpose for this trip was going to Metallica’s concert on June 19th.  [Firenze Rocks](https://www.firenzerocks.it/)  is an event that took 4 days this year, it was in an hippodrome and according to their announcement, 200k people participated in 4 days! We joined only day#4 and have seen Greta Van Fleet, Jerry Cantrell (founder of Alice in Chains) along with Metallica.

I should admit that waiting under sun from 1pm till 9pm was a bit exhausting. It was quite fun and worth though! And it was my first pogo dance which was a bit extreme haha. They are old now, end of their 50s, but it doesn't mean that they lost their energy. It’s still there.

As I said, I was there for 4 days and the concert took only one day. In other days, it was mostly re-visiting some places, chasing the best pasta and pizza in town. However, I finally had a chance to visit the  [**Uffizi Gallery**](https://www.uffizi.it/en/the-uffizi)! Thanks to its rich Renaissance collection, it’s definitely one of the most famous museums in the world. Here are the random notes about the gallery:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*xsA8J3RnHtEOICZR_FVDfA.jpeg)

1.  'Ufizzi' means  _offices_ in Italian, and it was constructed to be an office for Medici’s. The architect was  **Giorgio Vasari.** He designed this U-shape museum and also the Vasari corridor. But that’s not all, you can also see his a few paintings in the gallery. I liked the  [**Portrait of Duke Alessandro de’ Medici**](https://www.uffizi.it/en/artworks/vasari-alessandro-portrait)  most.
2.  It has arts mostly between 13th and 20th centuries. It means that it includes pre and post Renaissance. And for Renaissance, let me name a few of the greatest artists:  **Michelangelo, Raphael, Leonardo Da Vinci, Botticelli.**
3.  Before Renaissance, the paintings were two dimensional. They didn’t have depth. Faces and other details were not realistic at all. An example is as follows:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*iZD4N19HQdkuHued)

*[source](https://www.uffizi.it/en/artworks/lippo-di-benivieni-madonna-with-child)*

More paintings can be found  [here](https://www.uffizi.it/en/search?query%5Bmatching_descriptive_tags%5D=14th+century). Another important thing is that most of the paintings had been religious, painting Madonna and the child, Jesus, Popes, etc. However these all changed with Renaissance.

4. During the transition to Renaissance, there were many absurd mistakes in the paintings. One good example is  [Battle of San Romano](https://www.uffizi.it/en/artworks/battle-of-san-romano):

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*WYpugO7-kAOT0Emv)

*[source](https://www.uffizi.it/en/artworks/battle-of-san-romano)*

The painter tried to create a depth and painted people, horses in different sizes from the perspective of the viewer. At the beginning it looks good. But many things are wrong:

-   The shape of the field is not straight. And some of the people who are far away as big as the people who are in the front.
-   There is one soldier lying on the right bottom. He is too small, and if he would stand, he would be as big as a child.
-   There is one brown horse on the right, who is kicking with its back legs. It doesn’t look real and good.

5. Before starting to talk about the infamous arts, it’s worth to mention that there is one special room called  *[Tribune](https://www.uffizi.it/en/artworks/the-tribune)*.There are paintings, sculptures, a dome, and marble ground in this room. And it’s forbidden to enter, you can only see it from three angles. This is how it looks like, the best view is from the main hall:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*EbAGcZQkt9GRqb9GXQRXZQ.jpeg)

*Tribune room*

The Venus sculpture might look familiar. Because it inspired Botticelli, but let’s talk about it a bit later. These sculptures are from ancient Roman and Hellenistic era and some of them are 1500–2000 years old.

6.  **Sandro Botticelli’s** many paintings are in the Uffizi Gallery but two of them stands out:  [**La Primavera**](https://www.uffizi.it/en/artworks/botticelli-spring)  and  [**The Birth of Venus**](https://www.uffizi.it/en/artworks/birth-of-venus)**:**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*8C2ZroGl--LvSNDoN02bag.jpeg)

*La primavera (Spring)*

One of the interesting things about this painting is that researchers found more than  **130 different types of plants**!

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*mEOUepCXhIdvO2fUgLi_hw.jpeg)

*Birth of Venus*

-   Botticelli was trained as a goldsmith and he did everything to show the freshness new-born Venus in the painting. He even  **mixed real gold into**  **this painting**  and that’s why Venus’s hair is still shining.
-   At first glance, this painting looks very realistic, but it’s  **not anatomically realistic**. For example, the angle of the left shoulder and the neck of Venus. Also, the girl’s leg on the left is in psychically impossible position. It can’t be at front like this.

> **_This masterpiece was the very first large-scale canvas produced in the Florentine Renaissance._** [**_Source_**](https://artincontext.org/botticelli-paintings/)

It was the first time after 1000 years that human body, mythological figures and characters (except religious figures like crucifixion of jesus etc.) were depicted naked. In that period, it had always been interpreted as pagan stuff. But Botticelli thought that  **physical beauty was a way of appreciating God**. This thought was adopted by other Florentine and Renaissance artists and that’s one of the reasons why these two paintings were revolutionary for Renaissance.

7.  **Michelangelo.** You can find his only finished panel painting in this gallery. And as far as I remember, there is no sculpture of him. You should visit other galleries and museums in Florence for sculptures, and Sistine Chapel in Vatican for his amazing paintings on the wall.  [Doni Tondo](https://www.uffizi.it/en/artworks/holy-family-known-as-the-doni-tondo)  is the painting:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*nzl1-T08DFkzcSOLwnlj8A.jpeg)

*aka The Holy Family*

As you can see, figures look like sculptures, and they’re not that realistic because of that.

8.  **Leonardo da Vinci.** There are only 2 paintings of him and one of them is an unfinished work. He had painted them during his early career before he left Florence. Additionally, he helped his master Verrocchio’s  [**the Baptism of Christ**](https://www.uffizi.it/en/artworks/verrocchio-leonardo-baptism-of-christ)  and made him upset because Verrocchio said that a 14-years old boy drew the most amazing angel face he has ever seen. This is the angel:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*DRlOaM3YDykfpXYhxr_gyQ.jpeg)

He was also a scientist and it’s possible to see scientific details and geometry in his paintings. Take a look at  [**Annunciation**](https://www.uffizi.it/en/artworks/annunciation)**:**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*W7oDo_XimDC5dgKeTYneFw.jpeg)

In this masterpiece, the angel’s wings, landscape/tree/flower details, the folds of clothes, the marble table and all other stuff show Leonardo’s style very well.

When you see his unfinished  [Adoration of the Magi](https://www.uffizi.it/en/artworks/leonardo-adoration-of-the-magi), you can understand mathematical perfection better. There is a pyramid at the center (from Mary’s head to the painting’s bottom) and circle (whole fans are in half circle).

9.  **Raphael.** When he came to Florence, we was inspired by two great artists: Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci. That’s why it’s possible to see their marks in his artworks. I liked his  [this painting](https://www.uffizi.it/en/artworks/raphael-st-john)  most.

Michelangelo, Raphael, and Leonardo lived in Florence at the same time. Think about how fruitful and artful those times were for Florentians. The funny thing is that Michelangelo didn’t get along well with Raphael and Leonardo. He blamed the former for plagiarism.

----------

We finished the top floor. But it’s not the end. There are many more things to see on the top and second floor. But I’ll finish Uffizi part with Caravaggio:

10. Caravaggio’s Medusa shield is in the gallery. It’s a bit brutal, it shows the death of Medusa:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*6FgHaG6gYtZppIg5clrX3w.jpeg)

It was sent to Medici’s family as a gift.

I was impressed by many other artworks but I tried to select only the most famous ones in this post. I’ll add many reference links at the end so that you can see and read more.

The top floor also has an amazing view of Ponte Vecchio and Arno river. Don’t forget to spend some time checking it out!

----------

In the previous post, I mentioned about one famous sandvich place: Panini Toscani. In this trip, I have learned that it’s not the only one. There are many more options and it’s a good option for lunch:  [All’Antico Vinaio](https://goo.gl/maps/33L1SyRsAPWCcuv69)  (queue was too long, so I couldn’t try it),  [Amici di Ponte Vecchio](https://g.page/amici-di-ponte-vecchio?share)  (their #2018 sandwich was very tasty!).

----------

I’ll finish the post by suggesting watching sunset from Piazzelo Michelangelo:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*kdJgr30ArCSXQ7YaCE9yUg.jpeg)

Florence offers a lot more stuff than I have written in the two blog posts. I think I can go there again and again and I’d never get bored. In my next time, I’m planning to visit  [Accademia Gallery](https://www.accademia.org/),  [the main cathedral](https://goo.gl/maps/fWo5CG7119733jxb6),  [Galileo Museum](https://goo.gl/maps/pqbrM7CpDWQLaPaRA).

**Final note:**  If you are planning to visit it in the summer, don’t forget to stay hydrated!
