Italy III: Florence
===================

Before getting started to give you details of this beautiful city, Florence, I would like to suggest you to read **Inferno**, which is one of the books of **Dan Brown**, and watch a few episodes of **Da Vinci's Demons**. There is also movie of Inferno, too. You might have an idea about history of Florence and I'm sure you'll be curious!

According to history books, we can call **Florence** the place **where** the **Renaissance began**. If we think of **Michelangelo, Da Vinci and Botticelli**, the greatest artists of Renaissance, **born and grown up here**, we can say that it is true! The **Medici family**, who were **extreme interested in art**, provided the environment for the work of these great artists and gave them unlimited opportunities. Therefore, they worked without any obstacles and started the Renaissance.

In addition, it is also the city of one the greatest poet, **Dante**! Thanks to him, world literature has a masterpiece, Divine Comedy. He wrote many other poems in Latin and Italian. You can visit his house (it is a museum now), **Casa di Dante**, in Florence.

Florence’s unique and symbolic building is **Florence Cathedral, originally The Cattedrale di Santa Maria del Fiore**. You can see this beauty wherever you go in the city. It has different parts such as Cathedral, Baptistry, Dome, and Bell Tower and there is a **combined ticket for 15 euros** to visit of them. **You should buy tickets in advance**. I didn't have the opportunity to enter, but next time I will for sure!

When you walk around the Cathedral, there are many shops and there is a small, cozy place where the **best sandwich** is made. I am talking about **Panini Toscani.** They make sandwiches according to your choices: of ham, cheese, etc. The good thing is they firstly introduce you to all of the options and you decide which one you want, after trying all of them. They also give you information about them: where it came from, how famous it is, etc. I strongly recommend you to try it!

After visiting **Piazza Del Duomo,** Cathedral and surroundings, I suggest you to walk towards to **Ponte Vecchio, another symbolic place of Florence**. However, before arriving to this famous bridge, you should stop at **Piazza della Signoria** because there are many things to pay attention to, such **as open-air sculpture museum**, **Loggia dei Lanzi**; **Palace of Vecchio, Palazzo Vecchio; Fountain of Neptune and replica of David**. This Palace has a few parts to visit and you can select your tickets according to your interests. For the rest of them, you can stare and examine as long as you want because they are in the square during the whole day.

**Galleria degli Uffizi**, which is located at the one corner of Piazza della Signoria, is another place that must be seen. Many masterpieces of great artists (for example Michelangelo, Raffaello, and Botticelli) are waiting for you in this gallery! Some people claim that Da Vinci was inspired when he visited this gallery.

If you walk a bit further from Uffizi, you can finally reach **Ponte Vecchio**. This bridge is referred to as Hitler’s favorite one because it’s the only one Germans didn’t bomb in World War II. If you think that Germans destroyed all of the bridges except this, you might have an idea how important it is. There are **many jewelry shops on it and a corridor above it**.

**Vasari Corridor** is a **passageway** between two palaces, Vecchio and Pitti. It starts from Palazzo Vecchio, joins Uffizi Gallery and Ponte Vecchio, then it ends at Palazzo Pitti. Dukes and other rulers used this corridor for changing palaces without local people interference. The bad thing is that most of the corridor can't be visited.

**Palazzo Pitti** is another important palace for Renaissance. It is **a vast museum** with lots of **masterpieces of Raphael and other greatest artists**. It has different parts such as Modern Art, Palatine Gallery, etc. Unfortunately, when I checked for **entrance tickets,** I saw **20-25 euros**. So it is expensive to visit this museum.

**The Boboli Garden** is **behind of Palazzo Pitti** and it was made by the Medici Family. There is 360 VR tour for this garden. You can check the website: [link](http://www.30fps.com/boboli/html/25pittiJaPCEn.html)

There are a few other places to visit like **Piazza della Repubblica, San Lorenzo Basilica**... However, I would like to mention another place.

**Piazzale Michelangelo** is the best place for me in Florence because you have a **very nice view** of the city. There is also another **replica of** **David** in this square. By the way, the **original David sculpture** was taken under protection **in Accademia**.
